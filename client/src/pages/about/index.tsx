        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <ul className={styles.rulesList}>
          <li>2-4 players</li>
          <li>36 cards in the deck; 6 is the lowest card rank</li>
          <li>each player is dealt six cards</li>
          <li>
            the bottom card of the stock is turned and placed face up on the table, its suit
            determining the trump suit for the current deal
          </li>
          <li>a trump card of any rank beats all cards in the other three suits</li>
          <li>the player who has the lowest trump card will be the first attacker</li>
          <li>the player to the attacker&apos;s left is always the defender</li>
          <li>there cannot be more than six attacks in each round</li>
          <li>
            the attacker opens their turn by playing a card face up on the table as an attacking
            card
          </li>
          <li>
            the defender responds to the attack with a higher-ranking defending card from their hand
          </li>
          <li>
            the defender must play a higher card of the same suit as the attack card or play a card
            of the trump suit
          </li>
          <li>
            if a defender is unwilling or unable to beat the most recent attack card, they may give
            up their defence and must pick up all the cards played during that round of attack
          </li>
          <li>
            for each new attack which is defended successfully by the defender, the player who led
            that attack (played the last attack card) may start a new attack
          </li>
          <li>
            if they cannot or if they pass, then the player to the left of the defender may start a
            new attack or pass the chance to attack to the next non-defender going clockwise around
            the table
          </li>
          <li>
            after the original attack, attacks can only be made if the new attack card matches the
            rank of any card which has already been played during that round
          </li>
          <li>
            if no other players are willing to make another attack or if the defender beats the
            sixth attack card, the defender has won the round of attacks
          </li>
          <li>
            in this case all cards from that round of attack are placed in the discard pile and the
            defender starts a new round of attacks as the attacker and the player to his or her left
            becomes the new defender
          </li>
          <li>
            but if the attack succeeds, the defender loses their turn and the attack passes to the
            player on the defender&apos;s left
          </li>
          <li>
            at the end of each round of attacks, each player draws new cards from the deck until
            they have six cards in their hand unless the deck has been exhausted
          </li>
          <li>the last person left with cards in their hand is the loser (the fool or durak)</li>
        </ul>
